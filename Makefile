# ~~~ Welcome to our Makefile ~~~
# We hope you enjoy your stay!
#
# We use `make` for quite a lot, so targets are defined across different
# `Makefile`s and `include`d here. Maybe that's a sign that we need a different
# system, but old habits die hard.
#
# This `Makefile` exports some generally-applicable `Makefile` variables that
# will apply across all of the `Makefile`s it `include`s, and it also defines
# some "wrapper" targets that will run generic `make` targets with values for
# specific subprojects plugged in:
# - `worker.*` for `apps/worker`
# - `api.*` for `apps/codecov-api`
# - `shared.*` for `libs/shared`
#
# These "wrapper" targets rely on two somewhat obtuse `make` features:
# - a "function" or "macro" of sorts that is expanded before each target to set
#   variables for that target. This is the `define` and `eval`/`call` stuff.
# - pattern rules, which let you match basically a wildcard in a rule name. A %
#   in a rule name matches anything, and then $* in the rule definition expands
#   to whatever was matched. If multiple rules can match, `make` picks the most
#   specific one (i.e. the one with the smallest `$*` value)
#
# If you run `make worker.build`, the wrapper target will set worker-specific
# values and then run `$(MAKE) _build` to run the generic `_build` target with
# worker's propagated through. 
#
# We are interested in making `umbrella` more of a monolith instead of a
# collection of subprojects. If and when we do, the goal is not to need the
# "wrapper" targets anymore; we should be able to set a single set of values for
# the variables used in the wrapper targets, delete the `_` from generic rule
# names like `_build` or `_save.requirements`, and invoke `make` on the same
# target no matter what.
