  # This job works around a strange interaction between reusable workflows and
  # path filters.
  #
  # When a job that uses a reusable workflow is skipped, a single check shows up
  # for it (e.g. `API CI / Test`). If the job is _not_ skipped, that check does
  # not appear and instead you see checks for all of the jobs nested in the
  # reusable workflow (`API CI / Test / Run tests`). There's no single check
  # that's consistently there which you can mark as required.
  #
  # Because this job does not use a reusable workflow, it will produce the same
  # check whether or not it is skipped. So, we can make this check required and
  # have it figure out whether the jobs we actually care about failed.
