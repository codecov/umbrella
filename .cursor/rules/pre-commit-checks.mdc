# Pre-commit Checks

Before creating a PR or making a commit, always run the project's pre-commit hooks to catch lint and formatting issues:

```bash
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

If either command produces changes, stage the fixes and include them in the commit.

This project uses `ruff` for both linting (`ruff check`) and formatting (`ruff format`), configured in `pyproject.toml` and enforced via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
