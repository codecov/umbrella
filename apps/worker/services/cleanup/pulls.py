    Flare is a field on a Pull object.
    Flare is used to draw static graphs (see GraphHandler view in api) and can be large.
    The majority of flare graphs are used in pr comments, so we keep the (maybe large) flare "available"
    in Archive storage while the pull is OPEN.
    If the pull is not OPEN, we dump the flare to save space.
    If we need to generate a flare graph for a non-OPEN pull, we build_report_from_commit
    and generate fresh flare from that report (see GraphHandler view in api).
    This will only update the _flare_storage_path field for pulls whose flare files were
    successfully deleted from storage.
