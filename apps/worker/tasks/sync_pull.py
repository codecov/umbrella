        This is the task that syncs pull with the information the Git Provider gives us

    The most characteristic piece of this task is that it centers around the PR.
        We receive a (repoid, pullid) pair. And we fetch all the information
            from the git provider to update it as needed.

        This mostly includes
            - Updating basic database fields around the PR, like author
            - Updating `base` and `head` of the PR
            - Updating the `diff` and `flare` information of the PR using the `report` of its head
            - Updating all the commits that point to this pull in case the pull is being merged
            - Clear the caches we have around this PR

        At the end we call the notify task to do notifications with the new information we have

            Determines if commit was merged with squash merge or not, by looking at the commits
                that were on the commit and the commits that are on the base branch now

            The logic here is that, if at least one commit of the PR made it into the base branch,
                then we know no ways of merging just that one commit without the other ones. So it
                is probable that the commit was merged with merge-commit (or some other strategy
                that moves all commits to the base branch).

            Notice that the reason we don't require all commits to be on the base branch now is
                because it's possible that the base branch moves so fast that by the time
                we check it part of the PR commits could have been merged via merge-commit, but
                are already out of the first page of commit listing.

            This also brings us the the limitation of this logic: if the base branch moves so fast
                that ALL the commits are out of the first page of listing when we check, we
                will assume (wrongly) that this was a squash commit
